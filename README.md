# Psychic-Game


The purpose of the game is to guess what letter has been chosen at random from a-z. 
    
  1. A random letter between a-z is chosen by the computer. 
  2. The player presses a letter key between a-z to attempt a guess.
  3. The letters are compared to see if they are the same. 
  4. Unless the player guess is === to the computer guess, "Guesses left:" will decrease by 1. 
  5. The player has 9 tries to press any letter and guess the right letter. 
  6. Each time the player guesses a letter, the letter is recorded on the screen "Your guesses so far:" (thus the users guess is being pushed to an array). 
  7. If the player guesses the right letter, "wins" will increase by 1. 
  8. If the player guesses incorrectly for all 9 guesses, "losses" will increase by 1 and the array will clear. 
  9. Once the player wins or loses, the game will reset to "guesses left: 9".
